#+TITLE: Notes on Magtogoek

* Issues.
** Wind data and correction
   Wind Gust is not Wind Speed. Change that.
   mean_wind_direction cannot be rotated twice.  min and max wind dir are not related to min/max speed.
   'max_wind_direction': "EGTDSS01", # THIS IS THE DIRECTION for wind gust. Which is not Dx of the anemometer
** Motion Correction in Adcp adcp/quality_control.py and load_navigation in navigation.
   A fix has been added in vicking_dat branche.
   The load_navigation can return None if lon, lat are missing from the files which will crash in quality_control.py.
   Furthermore, the motion_correction function in quality_control.py needs to have longitude (and latitude) data to check for finite values.
   The code can crash there also since there is no if or else.

  
* Functionality
** Tool to merge dataset and recompute metadata / format existing data.

* Commands to add.
** Navigation command.
*** Add Navigation loadable from csv file maybe ?
   -n nc_filename
   -o output netcdf4 file name
   -l longitude_var_name latitude_var_name (2 args)
   -t time_dims_name
   -w length of the averaging window

** Rotation command.

* Improvements
** ADCP PROCESS CONFIG
** ADCP QUALITY CONTROL
*** Change PG good test for beam coord. each should be greater than 25% sum > 100.
*** ADCP figures
plt.show(block=False)
** ODF
*** time are printed with singles quotes
*** move odf specific config in .ini to separate header
** Add BODC name de compute nav variables (lon, lat)
** Make a sci_tools.py module for the scientific function.
** Make DataClasses from loaded platform file.
** Put navigation and Odf in their own sub package.
** Imports configuration files.
   + P01, GF3, CF, etc.
   + Maybe put this in the ConfigFiles.
   + Set the default configuration for the ConfigFiles.
   + Set default Value for the quick processing.

** Platform files.
   + Make use of a single platform file that can be modify by the user.

** VERSION:
    + Put the version.py info in the __ini__.py ?
    + VERSION in app is not the same variable as in the setup.
     
* Missing
** adcp
   + rotate command: mtgk rotate NETCDF_FILES ANGLE -o [output_files]
 
* Others
** Review documentations
