#+TITLE: Notes on Magtogoek

* Issues.
** Motion Correction in Adcp adcp/quality_control.py and load_navigation in navigation.
   The load_navigation can return None if lon, lat are missing from the files which will crash in quality_control.py. Furthermore, the motion_correction function    in quality_control.py needs to have longitude (and latitude) data to check for finite values. The code can crash there also since there is no if or else. A fix    has been added in vicking_dat branche.
  

* Commands to add.
** Navigation command.
*** Add Navigation loadable from csv file maybe ?
   -n nc_filename
   -c csv_filename
   -o output netcdf4 file name
   -l longitude_var_name latitude_var_name (2 args)
   -t time_dims_name
   -w length of the averaging window

** Rotation command.

* Improvements
** ~/.magtogoek configuration files.
   + P01, GF3, CF, etc.
   + Maybe put this in the ConfigFiles.
   + Set the default configuration for the ConfigFiles.
   + Set default Value for the quick processing.
** Platform files.
   + Make use of a single platform file that can be modify by the user.
     
* Missing
** Make figure while processing
   + ...

   + Only for directional quantities (u,v, adcp ?)
   + mtgk rotate NETCDF_FILES ANGLE -o [output_files]
   + Rotate data clockwise and adds u, v are then not East and North anymore.
      
* Others
** Review documentations
