* Configurations
** Leading_Trim and Trailing_Trim.
Leading and trailing trim are now replace by 2 sets of parameters: start_time/end_time and start_trim/end_trim.
The data are first cut with start/end trim if both are provided.
Version 0 config file can still use the leading and trailing trim parameters.

* Processing
Netcdf file are saved after the raw data has been loaded.
These files have the same name has the default_output_path but with the suffix '_raw'.
Reprocessing will use the '<default_output_path>_raw.nc' to process data unless the flag `--force-raw` is used.
e.g. `mtgk process my_config.ini --force-raw`
